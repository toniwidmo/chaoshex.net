<h2>ChaosHex</h2>

<p>Cyber Magic tool for hacking reality (casting spells).</p>

<p>There have been 3 versions of ChaosHex. The first was written around 1996 and worked on the MSDOS command line. The second version is an open source BASH script. The third version is web based.</p> 
<p>What they all have in common is a means of selecing a spell based on the colours of the chaosphere, a template to construct a statement of intent, and a visualisation to enable a better trance for spell casting.</p>

<h3>MSDOS Version</h3>
    
<p>The first was written around 1997, when the programmer was 23 years old, and worked on the MSDOS command line. It had a dependency of QBASIC for its visualisations. It had a cryptic interface, but was well received by the few people that got to test it. Sadly the code for this version has been lost. 
    A copy may exist on an old hard drive the programmer intends to get around to restoring. 
    If it can be recovered, the code will be released under GPL3 like the more recent versions.</p>
    
<h3>BASH version</h3>
<p>The BASH version works on the Linux command line or any other OS that supports BASH scripts. The code was preserved on SourceForge.</p>

<h3>Web Version</h3>
<p>This version works as a module for a NoseJS website. You can try it from the menu of this website, which runs NoseJS software. It has a more friendly to use GUI interface, although you can still type to the embedded terminal if you prefer, and have to type when it comes to the statement of intent parts.
    It also includes some bonus features not present in the original, such as the abiliy to optionally integrate EnigMagick API for gematria.
